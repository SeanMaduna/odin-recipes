            For roasting
            
            1 cup (240ml) hot water
            Instructions
             
            Pat dry the chicken using paper towels and let it get to room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
            Preheat the oven to 350F (180C), with fan on.
            
            In a bowl combine all spices, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and dried herbs with the olive oil.
            Season the cavity with salt and pepper.
            Coat the chicken with olive oil mixture, on all sides. If not already tied up, tie the legs with a cooking string.  Set aside at room temperature until you prepare the vegetables for roasting.
            Cut red potatoes and sweet potatoes into wedges, the fennel bulb into thick slices and place in a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, caraway powder, drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat.
            Place the oven rack on top of the vegetables and place the chicken on the center of the rack with breast side up.
            Stuff the chicken with 1 lemon cut into quarters and with two fresh rosemary sprigs and fresh thyme.
            Pour 1 cup (240ml) hot water into the baking dish and place in the preheated oven.
            Roast for about 20 minutes per pound (45 minutes per kg), in my case for 80 minutes. Baste the chicken with the dripping sauce, every 30 minutes.
            If water evaporated too early, add another up ½ cup hot water into the pan.
            Check the internal temperature until it reaches 165°F (75°C).
            Place the chicken onto a serving platter, arrange the vegetables around it and let it sit for 15-20 minutes before carving.</li>
